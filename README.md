Single Worker Production Game in Unity 3D. The objective is to finish many orders as quickly as possible. You must pick up the order (from the orders station) and your tools/resources (from the materials station), then bring them to the work station to work on the product order. When the product is ready, you must carry the product to the finished products station and ship it. Tools/resources can wear out. When it does, you must bring new ones from the materials station to the work station. The worker can carry one item at a time. (Commands: "P": Pick Up, "D": Drop Off, "W": Work On, "F": Ship Finished Product)
